The answer to this question is actually quite simple. To do this, you would only need to know one formula to find how long a period is. This formula is: </p>

As Galileo proved in 1581, the angle has no actual effect on the frequency of the ocsillations (or the pendulum period).
<br>
Therefore, with this formula, to find the time for a pendulum period, we will only need to know the value of gravity (g), which is constant as 9.8 meters/s<sup>2</sup> on earth, and the pendulum length (L), which is basically the length of the string in which the string is suspended.
<br>
Example: If the pendulum length (L) is 50 cm, then if we were to neglect air resistance and/or stupid people waving around their hands, a period would last for around 1.42 seconds (3 s.f.)

<b>Hang on a moment!</b>

<br>
Yes, you might be thinking: how long must the pendulum length be so that one period would be one second?

The answer is simple:
