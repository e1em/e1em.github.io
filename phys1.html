So, what is a pendulum? Well, it is a weight suspended from the pivot. They were used as clocks (I guess they are now, but not as much). </p>
<h3 align="center"> So, how do you calculate the length of a period?</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">
The answer to this question is actually quite simple. To do this, you would only need to know one formula to find how long a period is. This formula is: </p>

As Galileo proved in 1581, the angle has no actual effect on the frequency of the ocsillations (or the pendulum period).
<br>
<br>
Therefore, with this formula, to find the time for a pendulum period, we will only need to know the value of gravity (g), which is constant as 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> on earth, and the pendulum length (L), which is basically the length from the mass point to the pivot.
<br>
<br>
Example: If the pendulum length (L) is 50 cm, then if we were to neglect air resistance and/or stupid people waving around their hands, a period would last for around 1.42 seconds (3 s.f.)
<br>
<br>
<b>Hang on a moment!</b>
<br>
<br>
Yes, you might be thinking: how long must the pendulum length be so that one period would be one second?
<br>
<br>
Well then, do you remember the formula above? As we can see, we have two variables in this example: gravity (g) and the pendulum period (T). This must mean that we can solve for the pendulum length!
<br>
<br>
You can watch the video to see how we can calculate this value, but for now, you'll have to trust us when we say that when we substitute the known values, the pendulum length is around 24.8 (3 s.f.) centimeters.
<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, for a period to last for one second, the length of the string used must be 24.8 cm (3 s.f.).
<br>
<br>
<b>BUT WAIT!</b>
<br>
<br>
Wait, you want to build a pendulum clock on the moon?! And you want to know how long your string has to be in order for the period to be exactly a second?
<br>
<br>
(sighs) Okay, then we'd have to calculate that again. Since the gravity on the moon is only 1.622m/s<sup>2</sup>, that'd mean that the pendulum length would be much shorter, at only 4.11 cm (3 s.f.). Have fun cutting and tying your ball onto that piece of string! 
<br>
<br>
In other words, if you really want to have a clock on the moon, use another method.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, this formula is how to measure the length of a pendulum swing if the mass of the string is neglegible! There are many more resources which you can find on the front page.
