The Revolution on March 1917, or known as the February Revolution (It is called the February Revolution as they used the Julian Calendar) was an uprising caused
 by the workers who wanted political change. When the army was brought in, they themselves staged a mutiny and refused to fight against the protestors. This led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the introduction of the dual government system.
<br>
<br>
However, what REALLY caused this revolution? Was it a sudden outburst? Well, here at E1em, we believe that it is a culmination of events that led to the Revolution. World War I acted as the catalyst for change in Tsarist Russia.
<br>
<br>
Let us first talk about the state of Tsarist Russia before the war. Economically, Russia was starting to see an improvement, with industrial production and especially agricultural production incrased dramatically. However, this increase
 was not enough to compare to other powers, like Britain or Germany.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the economy was growing under Tsarist Russia, but the lives of peasants and social workers were still really bad (Click <a href="his2.html">here</a> for more information). Besides, Tsarist Russia was a conservative and religious society. One problem with this was that there was often domestic violence, and that women could not divorce.
<br>
<br>
The politics under the Tsar was quite terrible to the Russian people at the time. They had a duma which had literally no power (see: the October Manifesto states "I [Tsar] can have a duma...but only if I agree". Besides, the Tsar had a lot of enemies (more information can be found <a href="his4.html">here</a>), most notably the Bolsheviks, the Mensheviks, the Cadets, and the Socialist Revolutionaries.
<br>
<br>
Things seemed to get better when the war broke out though. There seemed to be an overwhelming increase in Tsar Nicholas II's popularity when they declared war on the Germanic and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, this was not to last. Food supplies went down a lot, and morality took a steep drop. 
<br>
<br>
In addition, the army was struggling mightily.
