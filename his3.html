The Revolution on March 1917, or known as the February Revolution (It is called the February Revolution as they used the Julian Calendar) was an uprising caused
 by the workers who wanted political change. When the army was brought in, they themselves staged a mutiny and refused to fight against the protestors. This led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the introduction of the dual government system.
<br>
<br>
However, what REALLY caused this revolution? Was it a sudden outburst? Well, here at E1em, we believe that it is a culmination of events that led to the Revolution. World War I acted as the catalyst for change in Tsarist Russia.
<br>
<br>
Let us first talk about the state of Tsarist Russia before the war. Economically, Russia was starting to see an improvement, with industrial production and especially agricultural production incrased dramatically. However, this increase
 was not enough to compare to other powers, like Britain or Germany.
