So, what is density? Well, density is a way of measuring how heavy something is per a certain volume. Let's have an example. One pound of feathers would way the same as one pound of lead, but since the density of lead is much higher, the one pound of lead would have a significantly lower volume than one pound of feathers.
<br>
<br>
Density is usually measured in kg/m<sup>3</sup> or g/cm<sup>3</sup>.
<br>
<br>
Now that the prequisite information is now shown so I don't look like a bad teacher, we shall now go through the questions on the worksheet.
<br>
<br>
First Question: <b> A piece of steel has a volume of 12 cm<sup>3</sup> and a mass of 96 grams. What is it density? </b>
<br>
----
<br>
Well, for this, we would divide the mass of the piece of steel by its volume. In this case, it would be 96/12, which is 8. Therefore, the density of this piece of steel is 8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
<br>
<br>
Second Question: <b> The density of hard wood is 0.78 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. What is the mass of 13 cm<sup>3</sup>?</b>
<br>
----
<br>
Well, now we have the values of the density and the mass, we can simply substitute them in to find the mass. Since every cubic centimeter would way 0.78 grams, we would just multiply 0.78 by 13, which would give us a result of 10.13, or the weight of this 13 cubic centimeter piece of wood.
<br>
<br>
Third Question: <b> The density of gold is 19 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. What is the volume of 95 g of gold?</b>
<br>
----
<br>
Again, we have two variables, meaning we can solve for the third one. Since 19 grams only accounts for 1 cubic centimeter of gold, we can divide 95 grams by 19 grams/centimeters<sup>3</sup>, meaning that the answer is 5 cubic centimeters.
<br>
<br>
Fourth Question <b> ESTIMATE THE MASS OF AIR IN THE SCIENCE LAB IF THE DENSITY OF AIR IS 1.3 KG/M<sup>3</sup>.</b>
<br>
----
<br>
ENTER:
<br>
<br>
wait for it...
<br>
<br>
let's be a bit patient here...
<br>
<br>
THE FERMI PROBLEM!!
<br>
Essentially, the Fermi Problem involves using smaller variables to estimate a larger one. We do not know how much air is in the science lab, but we can try to find the volume of the classroom and the space the desks take up. 
<br> <br>
Let us say that the dimensions of the science lab is 2m x 10m x 15m. This means that the volume of the science lab would be 300 m<sup>3</sup>.
<br> <br>
Now, let us say that there are four tables in a science lab. The dimensions are 2.5m x 0.8m x 0.8m, meaning that each table has a volume of 1.6 m<sup>3</sup>.
<br> <br>
Therefore, we can now find the area in the science lab which would be filled with air:
<br>
<br>
<h3 align="center"> 300 - (4 x 1.6) = 293.6 </h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3 align="center"> 293.6 m<sup>3</sup> x 1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup> = 381.7 kg</h3>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p align="center">
And there we have it! Our estimate shows that there would be around 381.7 kg of air in our science lab! 
<br>
Oh yes, please remember that this estimate may vary a bit with procedure and the depth of it. The estimate would probably get smaller if we were to account more tables, sinks, people...etc. 
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!!
