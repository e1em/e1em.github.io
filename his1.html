Rasputin, or Grigori Yefimovitch Rasputin [Григорий Ефимович Распутин] (1869-1916) was a Russian peasant and a claimed spiritual healer. 
He was brought in by the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, to help the internal bleeding of their son. (His son had haemophilia, meaning that the blood wouldn't clot, and would bleed on until death). Apparently, he saved the kid, Alexei.
<br>
Since then, he gained lots of power, most likely because he was the lover of the Queen at the time. 
<br>
<br>
Despite being uneducated and only an alleged spiritual healer, he gained lots of power during a short time, due to being considered as a womanizer and his incompetence at the job. This led to more hatred towards him (evident from the numerous assassination attempts) and the imperial family in general.
Many historians believe that he was a contributing factor to the downfall of the Russian Monarchy.
<br>
<br>
He has been quite popular in modern culture, most notably the song "Rasputin" by Boney M, a German band. Below, we will analyze the lyrics.

There lived a certain man in Russia 
<a class="zhideDisplay">

<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
When this song was written, Rasputin had already died 72 years ago (a long time ago).
</span>
</a>
<br>
He was <a class="zhideDisplay">
<b> big </b>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
Rasputin was 193 cm (6'4" in Imperial Units) and around 250 pounds heavy.
</span>
</a> and strong, in
<a class="chideDisplay">
<b> his eyes a flaming glow </b>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
Rasputin was known to have a very intense and fierce glare.
</span>
</a>
<br>
Most people looked at him with terror and fear <br>
<a class="bhideDisplay">
<b> But to Moscow Chicks he was such a lovely dear </b>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
Rasputin had a reputation as a womanizer, which included having an affair with the Queen.
</span>
</a><br>
He could preach the <a class="zhideDisplay">
<b> bible </b>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
Rasputin was known to explain the Bible very well and in simple terms.
</span>
</a> like a preacher<br>
Full of ecstacy and fire<br>
But he also was the kind of teacher<br>

Lover of the <a class="bhideDisplay">

<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
Rasputin was known to have an affair with the Queen, Alexandra Feodorovna, which made him powerful.

</a><br>
There was a cat that really was gone<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest <a class="bhideDisplay">

<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
The word 'machine' refers to the repeated behaviour of being in affairs.
</span>
</a><br>
It was a shame how he <a class="bhideDisplay">
<b> carried on </b>
<span class="showDisplayOnHover">
He would continue his behaviour and to have lots of power, 
</span>
</a><br>
<br>
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar<br>
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar<br>
In all affairs of state he was the man to please<br>
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze<br>
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer<br>
Though she'd heard the things he'd done<br>
She believed he was a holy healer<br>
Who would heal her son<br>
<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
There was a cat that really was gone<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
It was a shame how he carried on<br>
<br>
<i>[Spoken:]</i><br>
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger<br>
for power became known to more and more people,<br>
the demands to do something about this outrageous<br>
man became louder and louder.<br>
<br>
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies<br>
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"<br>
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms<br>
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms<br>
Then one night some men of higher standing<br>
Set a trap, they're not to blame<br>
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding<br>
And he really came<br>
<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
They put some poison into his wine<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"<br>
<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Lover of the Russian queen<br>
They didn't quit, they wanted his head<br>
RA RA RASPUTIN<br>
Russia's greatest love machine<br>
And so they shot him till he was dead<br>
<br>
<i>[Spoken:]</i> Oh, those Russians...
