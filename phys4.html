Newton's Laws of Motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it. These are the three laws:
<br>
<br>
<b> I - Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it.</b>
<br>
This is more commonly referred to as the "Law of Inertia".
<br>
<br>
<b> II - The force is equal to the mass multiplied by the acceleration.</b>
<br>
The formula of this law is F = ma. 
<br>
<br>
<b>III - For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</b>
<br>
This means that the forces always come in pairs, and that the opposite forces involved are of the same force.
<br>
<br>
<h3 align="center"> QUESTIONS!</h3>
<br>
<br>
1. When a rifle shoots out a bullet, is the acceleration of the bullet faster, equal, or slower than the recoiling rifle?
<br>
<br>
2. When a car bumps into you, is there more force applied on the car or on you?
<br>
<br>
3. If you rolled a ball on a frictionless surface. Would the ball need force to continue rolling?
<br>
<br>
4. A force of 50N is applied on a 5 kg block. What is the acceleration of this block? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 align="center"> ANSWERS</h3>
1. <b>Faster. </b> Although Newton's Third Law states that the force on the rifle and the bullet are similar. However, the bullet is lighter, and therefore will accelerate faster.
<br>
<br>
2. <b>Equal Force.</b> Newton's Third Law, everyone!
<br>
<br>
3. <b> No, it would not.</b> The reason why a ball on earth would stop after you roll it is because there is an opposite friction force acting upon it.
<br>
<br>
4. <b> 10 m/s<sup>2</sup></b>. 50 = 5 x a, and therefore a = 10.
