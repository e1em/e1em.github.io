So, what is speed? Well, speed is the time it takes to move from a distance to another distance. It is measured in metres per second. A Grand Prix Racing Car, for example, moves at around 100 metres per second.
<br>
You might've seen speed measured in km/h, or kilometres per hour.
<br>
<br>
<h3 align="center"> HOW TO CONVERT M/S TO KILOMETRES PER HOUR?</h3>
<br>
<p align="center"> 
Well, to do this, we can do this through two simple processes. Let us say that the speed of James was 4 metres per second.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, we need to change the denominator from seconds to hours. We can do this by multiplying the current metres per second time by 3600, as 3600 seconds is equivalent to an hour.
<br>
(So James would run at a speed of 4 x 3600, or 14 400 metres per hour.)
<br>
<br>
Now that this is done, we simply divide the current number of metres into kilometres. 
<br>
(This means that James runs at a speed of 14 km/h)
<br>
<br>
We have converted 4 m/s into 14 km/h through these three simple steps! Yay, you win a gold star.
<br>
<br>
(I'm not giving it to you though. You can download one from Google Images.)
</p>
<h3 align="center"> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPEED AND VELOCITY?</h3>
<p align="center">
Speed is a scalar. It measures the time it takes to move a certain distance. However, it doesn't show the direction.
<br> Velocity, however, is a vector, meaning that it shows BOTH direction and speed! (Vector, the character from Despicable Me, said this when he introduced himself to Gru, other than the fact that instead of the word speed, he used magnitude)
</p>
<h3 align="center"> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN VELOCITY DURING A TIME PERIOD CALLED?</h3>
<p align="center">
The difference in velocity during a time period is called acceleration. It is also a vector, meaning that it also detects direction. Acceleration is measured in m/s<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<h3 align="center"> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN ACCELERATION DURING A TIME PERIOD CALLED?</h3>
<p align="center">
The difference in acceleration is called a jerk. It is more commonly used as an insult. Jerk is measured in m/s<sup>3</sup>.

If you are finished with this, you can go on to the next lesson.
