Before we even talk about parts of a cell, let us first introduce cells. Cells are the basic units of all living things! There are two types of cells: Animal and Plant cells. Here is a basic labelling of the two types of cells.
</p>

</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
The three basic parts of an animal cell are <b> nucleus</b>, the<b> cytoplasm</b>, and the <b> cell membrane.</b>
<br>
<br>
The <b>nucleus </b>is the brain of the cell! It controls the movement of the cell, and it also contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This genetic material is in the form of DNA.
<br>
<br>
The <b>cytoplasm </b>is a jelly-like fluid which fills the cell. Organelles are contained in the cytoplasm and are protected by it. More on Organelles will be <a href="bio1extend.html"> here</a>.
<br>
<br>
The <b>cell membrane</b> is a selectively permeable (this will be important when learning <a href="bio2.html">diffusion</a>) membrane. It is used to protect the cell from the surroundings, as well as controlling what goes in and out of the cell.

This is a plant cell. As you can see, aside from having a nucleus, cytoplasm and a cell membrane, it also contains a <b> vacuole</b>, <b>chloroplasts</b>, and a<b> cell wall</b>.
<br>
<br>
The <b> vacuole </b>isolates harmful material, and stores food or nutrients for the cell.
<br>
<br>
The <b>chloroplast </b>is an organelle unique to a plant. It performs photosynthesis, the process of changing water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. Animals do not photosynthesize and therefore do not have this organelle in their cells.
<br>
<br>
The <b>cell wall </b> is a layer outside the cell membrane which further protects and supports the cell.

Now you have a basic understanding of the cells, you can go to the next class about organelles!
