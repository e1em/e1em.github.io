<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHEESEBURGER</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LIVE REPORTS OF THIS CASE OF A MISSING CHEESEBURGER!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>REPORT: December 10th, 09:55:19</strong></h3>
<p>A week-old cheeseburger, by the name of Chi Sburga has been reported missing from his parents, Mr. Bif Sburga and Mrs. Turki Sburga, after casually strolling to a human-owned building with a large double arch sign on its label. After a few minutes inside the store, he went completely out of Mr and Mrs. Sburga&rsquo;s sight.</p>
<p>Chi Sburga is classified as a W3X Cheeseburger, or for the normal burger citizen, a 10 x 10 x 5 cm cheeseburger with onions and pickles in place of the more popular choice of lettuce.</p>
<p>Not much of the crime from the scene could be recalled by Chi&rsquo;s parents, but they were kind enough to give some facts regarding his short life. Chi Sburga was created on October 4, 2013. Unlike most burgers, Chi Sburga was able to receive an education, going to the Raffles Chips Institution with other foods from the &ldquo;double arch store&rdquo;, referred by the two-legged creatures as &ldquo;McDonalds&rdquo;. His favourite classes enjoyed Physical Education and phychology, which were reflected in his hobbies, hiking and learning about human behaviour. He would also often play table tennis at Victoria Park every Sunday, before mysteriously disappearing on December 10, 2015.</p>
<p>Mrs. Turki Sburga noted that when Chi was born, he didn&rsquo;t have any pickles on him. They grew on him. We are unsure how this is relevant, or if this was an intended pun.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 10th, 10:50:30</strong></h3>
<p>Our main detective for this crime, Big Mack, has brought to us an expert scientist on the human anatomy to help describe this phenomenon, named James Singh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that Chi was eaten up by a human and into the mouth,&rdquo; Singh explained. &ldquo;The mouth contains teeth and the saliva. The front teeth cut up Sburga, and the mucus helps lubricate the food so that it is easier to chew and swallow. The saliva inside the mouth also contains the enzyme &ldquo;salivary amylase&rdquo; created by the salivary glands. This would probably digest the starch molecules in his two buns and break them down into maltose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What this means is that Chi is going through the chemical digestion of a human and may come out as a dark brown substance a few days later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stay tuned for future updates.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 10th, 10:53:20</strong></h3>
<p>Our so-called experts from the lab (forgive us, we had a limited budget) believes that by this time, Chi has already arrived the stomach from the oesophagus through the cardiac sphincter for a long time. Here, we define the stomach as a muscular bag, which contains food.</p>
<p>Big Mack has also been able to find one of the many perpetrators from the scene. This perpetrator is by the name of Mr. P. Epsin, a pepsin enzyme. In our latest interview, we were able to extract some important information about how the stomach works. This could potentially help us find the whereabouts of Chi in further detail.</p>
<p>Now to the interview.</p>
<p><strong>BM: Mr. Epsin, can you please tell us what you are?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P: I&rsquo;m Pepper Epsin, but known as Mr. P Epsin. I am a protease enzyme, named pepsin. My job is to break down proteins in meat, like burger patties, into shorter chains of amino acids, commonly known as peptides. Burger patties are quite delicious.</p>
<p><strong>BM: Where do you come from?</strong></p>
<p>P: I come from the stomach. More specifically, I am part of the gastric juice formed by the glands in the stomach. You see, the gastric juices not only contain pepsin like me to break down the proteins, but also Hydrochloric Acid. This changes the pH to 2, which is not only awesome for me, as I work best in those contains, but also for the human, since it is good for killing harmful microbes.</p>
<p><strong>BM: This sounds like the chemical digestion in the food. Do you know anything about mechanical digestion?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P: Of course! We have all experienced it before. *laughs*. To further break up food that come in from the oesophagus, there are muscular contractions known as peristalsis. This process will give us smaller food to digest, which makes our lives much easier.</p>
<p><strong>BM: How long do you think Chi Sburga will stay in this horrible, acidic stomach?</strong></p>
<p>P: I love the acidity! Normally, food will stay in the stomach for 1-4 hours, but since cheeseburgers are created for Americans, he does contain fat and will stay longer. He would probably come out digested, which we would call chyme.</p>
<p><strong>BM: And where will he go?</strong></p>
<p>P: He will leave through the pyloric sphcinter into the duodenum!</p>
<p><strong>BM: Cool. You&rsquo;re arrested for being a part of the stomach that is trying to break down this innocent cheeseburger, named Chi Sburga.</strong></p>
<p>(P is enzyme-cuffed. A piece of string is stuck onto his mouth and he is no longer able to speak)</p>
<p>Stay tuned for future updates.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 10th, 15:53:50</strong></h3>
<p>The bile police has spotted food entering the duodenum. One of the bile police rambled on regarding the chemical reactions that happen inside this short passage in the small intestine. We weren&rsquo;t interested in hearing were very lucky to understand more of this interesting passage from an expert. (We also didn&rsquo;t have to pay him, volunteer work for the win!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a bile police, we do two things. Firstly, the food that comes from the stomach has a low pH Value. We, as well as the pancreatic juice, are basic, so we help neutralize the stomach acid so that the enzymes in the pancreatic juice can do work. Secondly, we mechanically break down fats, so Chi Sburga could&rsquo;ve been broken down by us. Sorry, our law is more important than Cheeseburger law and must be upheld. Anyway, we break down fats with our bile salt into small fat drops.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Big Mack was previously unaware of the pancreas&rsquo; existence, he didn&rsquo;t know where it was. Thankfully, we were also able to find an army of enzymes in the pancreatic juice.</p>
<p>The few regiments include the lipase, pancreatic amylase, maltase, and trypsin. The lipase regiment contains the lipase enzyme that break down the fats and oils into fatty acids and glycerol. The pancreatic amylase will continue breaking down any starch molecules not converted by the salivary amylase into maltose. Then, the maltase on the epithelium cells will break down the maltose into glucose, the remains of the bun. Trypsin is also a regiment, but we didn&rsquo;t hear a lot about it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 10th, 17:53:00</strong></h3>
<p>Chi Sburga is last sighted at the jejunum, the second part of the small intestine. Here, Big Mack found it especially difficult to move around. Although the solution is only slightly alkaline, there are lots of hair on the sides of the small intestine, known as villi. These villi are semipermeable, and all the nutrients broken down by the pancreatic juice would be diffused into the bloodstream, or actively transported. With no way to determine which molecule were part of the cheeseburger, it seems as if Chi Sburga has been broken down and used as fuel for the creature he studied most - the two-legged human.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: December 10th, 21:53:20</strong></p>
<p>Chi Sburga is predicted to have already slowly past the ileum of the intestine, where the last products of digestion are taken into the body. Now, the remaining and indigestible parts of Chi are present in the colon, where water and other key nutrients from waste material will be taken out and recycled back into the body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Chi has survived the chewing and breaking down of his body, or peristalsis, or the acidic conditions and the enzymes working on taking nutrients from his body and converting those to glucose and amino acids, then it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that he will stay alive by this time. Unfortunately, the chemical digestion and mechanical digestion just isn&rsquo;t something we envision a living being like a cheeseburger surviving. However, we&rsquo;ll make the final call after we see the defacated version of Chi.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for future updates.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 10th, 23:53:00</strong></h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re waiting. Patiently.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 11th, 01:53:20</strong></h3>
<p>Still waiting. Not-so-but-still-patiently.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 11th, 03:53:20</strong></h3>
<p>Big Mack forgot to do his research on how food will stay in the large intestine. This calls for a practical.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 11th, 05:53:20</strong></h3>
<p>This is taking a long time. After the commercial break, please.</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 11th, 14:53:20</strong></h3>
<p>We have decided to not have periodic 2-hour updates, and instead update you when we finally see Sburga. Could take some time though. *yawns*</p>
<h3><strong>UPDATE: December 12th, 08:53:20</strong></h3>
<p>In approximately 33 hours since entering the large intestine, we see that all that remains of Chi is a rather stinky blob known as faeces. It has been created 5 hours ago, but it is only now that the remains of this inquisitive and bright Chi has been excreted. Big Mack was very reluctant to approach the excretion (or known by kids as poop)</p>
